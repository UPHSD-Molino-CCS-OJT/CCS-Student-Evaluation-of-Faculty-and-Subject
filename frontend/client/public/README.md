## Public Assets

This folder contains public assets that are served directly by the React application.

### Folder Structure:
- `images/` - Image assets (logos, icons, etc.)
- `fonts/` - Custom fonts
- `favicon.ico` - Site favicon

### Notes:
- Files in this folder are accessible at the root URL
- Reference files as: `/logo.png` (without `/public/`)
- Use Vite's asset handling for better optimization when possible
